In this article, we will show you how to use the latest version of the TOPER CALCULATOR TOOL for B777 and B737 in P3D. You will need to have the following prerequisites:
 
- A valid license for P3D v4 or v5
- A valid license for the TOPER CALCULATOR TOOL for B777 and/or B737
- The PMDG 777 and/or 737 NGXu add-ons installed in P3D
- An internet connection to access the online database of runways and weather

Once you have these ready, you can follow these steps to use the tool:

1. Launch the TOPER CALCULATOR TOOL from your desktop or start menu.
2. Select the aircraft type (B777 or B737) and the variant (e.g. B777-300ER or B737-800) from the drop-down menus.
3. Enter the airport ICAO code (e.g. KJFK or EGLL) and the runway number (e.g. 04L or 27R) in the corresponding fields. The tool will automatically retrieve the runway data from the online database.
4. Enter the current weather conditions such as temperature, pressure, wind direction and speed in the corresponding fields. You can also use the *Get METAR* button to fetch the latest weather report from the internet.
5. Enter the aircraft weight and balance data such as zero fuel weight, fuel weight, payload weight and center of gravity in the corresponding fields. You can also use the *Load from Sim* button to import these data from P3D if you have already loaded your aircraft in the simulator.
6. Select the desired takeoff configuration options such as engine rating (TO, TO-1 or TO-2), flap setting (e.g. 5 or 15), anti-ice (on or off) and runway condition (dry or wet) from the drop-down menus.
7. Click on the *Calculate* button to generate the takeoff performance data. The tool will display the results such as V1, VR, V2, thrust setting, derate option, runway length required and more in a table below.
8. You can also click on the *Export to Sim* button to export these data to P3D and set them automatically in your aircraft's FMC.

Congratulations! You have successfully used the TOPER CALCULATOR TOOL for B777 and B737 in P3D. You can now enjoy a realistic and safe takeoff with your Boeing aircraft. Happy flying!
